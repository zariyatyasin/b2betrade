                  By utilizing the Site, you acknowledge that it functions as an
                  online platform facilitating your purchase of products at the
                  indicated prices, accessible from any location and at any
                  time, using a payment method of your preference. It is
                  imperative to understand that we solely act as a facilitator
                  and do not partake in or exert control over any transactions
                  on the Site or on a payment gateway provided by an independent
                  service provider. Hence, the sales contract for products on
                  the Site constitutes a strictly bipartite agreement between
                  you and the sellers, while the payment processing involves
                  you, the service provider, and, in the case of prepayments
                  with electronic cards, your issuing bank. Consequently, the
                  payment contract on the Site remains exclusively a bipartite
                  agreement between you and the service provider listed on our
                  Site.

                  At B2BETrade, we operate as a platform facilitating
                  transactions between buyers and sellers in the B2B wholesale
                  marketplace. It is crucial to note that we do not provide any
                  explicit or implicit representations or warranties regarding
                  the specifics of products or services listed on our platform,
                  including aspects such as quality, value, or saleability.
                  These products and services are offered by third parties. We
                  neither implicitly nor explicitly endorse the sale or purchase
                  of any products or services on B2BETrade, and we bear no
                  liability for errors or omissions, whether originating from us
                  or third parties. Responsibility for the performance and
                  fulfillment of contracts lies solely with the parties involved
                  – you and the sellers. B2BETrade is not obligated to mediate
                  or resolve disputes arising from these transactions. During
                  any transaction on our platform, we do not acquire title or
                  rights over the products or services offered by sellers.
                  Consequently, we hold no obligations or liabilities concerning
                  the contracts formed between you and the seller(s). Delays or
                  dissatisfaction arising from product unavailability, being out
                  of stock, or on back order are beyond our responsibility.
                  Please be aware that pricing information on the Site may be
                  subject to technical errors or typographical mistakes. In such
                  instances, the seller or the Site reserves the right to cancel
                  your order without prior notice or any associated liability.
                  Prepayments made for such orders will be refunded in
                  accordance with our stipulated refund policy. For any queries

                  Stock Availability: The fulfillment of orders is contingent

                  holidays, or other unforeseen circumstances. Cancellation:
                  B2BETrade reserves the absolute right to cancel any order
                  before dispatch. This decision may be influenced by various

                  expiration, defects, malfunctions, or inaccuracies in
                  information due to technical or typographical errors, or any
                  other valid reason. Refund Timeline: In the event of order
                  cancellation, the payment for the respective order will be
                  refunded within 10 to 15 working days. However, exceptional
